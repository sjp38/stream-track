For contributions, please refer to the linux kernel development process[1] and
send patches to sjpark@amazon.com or pull-requests to
https://github.com/sjp38/stream-track via Github.  The contributions should
have proper 'Signed-off-by:' tags[2].  The tag will be considered same to that
of the linux kernel development process.

There are two branches, 'master' and 'next'.  Changes first merged in 'next',
get tested, and finally merged in 'master', if the tests show no problem.  So,
please base your work on 'next'.
